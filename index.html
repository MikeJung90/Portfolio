          <h3 class="intro">Hello, my name is Mike, it is nice to meet you!</h3>
          <p>
            I’m currently a student in Thinkful, learning to become a web developer / full-stack developer. I'm located in Atlanta, GA!
          </p>
          <p>
            I love playing video games, drinking coffee and beer, watching random funny videos in youtube, and finally watching my ideas come to life through coding.
          </p>

          <h2 class="story">Here is a short story about my life</h2>
          <p>
            When I was around 5 to 10 I loved playing with legos and building my own creative ideas to life, rather then following instructions on a piece of paper. I even dreamed of becoming an inventor and create cool things that appeared in my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of 11, I fell in love with computers, mainly playing video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of 15, I started to dig deeper into how computers and programmings come to life. Due to my fascination I tried to study in different aspects of computers, be it from building the computer itself to software products and programming codes.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I graduated from High School and started my university life, like being struck by lightning, my life deteriorated due to various reasons. I had to put aside my school life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of 18, I started working full time plus more hours and completely lost sight of my original goal. And this repeated-life of just work, eat, and sleep continued for almost a decade. Thankfully due to my best friends persuasion of following my own dream, I was able to climb out of the dark pit that I was trapped in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now here I am, once again, pursuing my dream and taking step-by-step to learning the wonders of programming. Plus I heard software engineers get free beer while on the job.
